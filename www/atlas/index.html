<h2><a id="general">General Information</a></h2>

<p>The NYU Value-Added Galaxy Catalog (NYU-VAGC) is a cross-matched
collection of galaxy catalogs maintained for the study of galaxy
formation and evolution. It includes carefully constructed <a
href="lss.html"> large-scale structure samples</a> useful for
calculating power spectra, correlation functions, etc.</p>

<p> This catalog is described in a <a
href="http://adsabs.harvard.edu/cgi-bin/nph-bib_query?bibcode=2005AJ....129.2562B&amp;db_key=AST&amp;data_type=HTML&amp;format=&amp;high=4144d3386a15235"> paper
published in
the Astronomical Journal</a>. Usage of the NYU-VAGC requires citing
this paper (as well as the appropriate <a href="cites.html">
citations</a> for component
catalogs and calibrations). </p>

<p> DR7, the final public sample, consists of 10417 sq deg of
and 7966 sq deg of spectroscopic coverage.  (The spectroscopic
coverage excludes SEGUE-2 data).</p>

<p> See <a href="notes.html"> important notes</a> for updates on the
DR6 and DR7 LSS samples.</p>

<p>See <a href="faq.html">the FAQ</a> for answers to some questions about
the NYU-VAGC. There is also a discussion of the
<a href="motivation.html">motivation</a> behind the NYU-VAGC, as well as
some of the <a href="science.html">science</a> being done with it.</p>

<p> Currently, no funding exists for the NYU-VAGC and we create it for
the warm, fuzzy feeling inside that it gives us when we think that
people might be using it. In order to feed that warm, fuzzy feeling we
greatly appreciate any feedback! </p>


<h2><a id="conditions">Conditions of use</a></h2>

<p> If you download NYU-VAGC data, we would appreciate you:</p>

<h2><a id="download">Downloading the data</a></h2>

<p> Here we describe how to get to the data, and <a href="#form">below</a>
we describe how the data is organized. </p>

<p> The public data release data is available through a set of
directories conforming to the data model described below. The base
URLs are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li> <a
href="http://sdss.physics.nyu.edu/vagc-dr7/vagc2">http://sdss.physics.nyu.edu/vagc-dr7/vagc2</a>

for the <a href="#datasweep">datasweeps</a> of the full SDSS DR7 catalog (only 90G)</li>
<li> <a
href="http://sdss.physics.nyu.edu/lss/dr72">http://sdss.physics.nyu.edu/lss/dr72</a>
for the large-scale structure samples (corresponds to $LSS_REDUX/dr72 below)</li>
</ul>
<p>
You can
retrieve this set of data automatically using Unix WWW downloaders
such as GNU <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/wget/">wget</a> or <a
href="http://curl.mirrors.redwire.net/">curl</a>. </p>


<h2><a id="form">Organization of the data</a></h2>

<p> All entries in the catalog are sources in the SDSS imaging survey,
either because they pass the Main sample target criteria (in some
version) or had an SDSS spectrum close to their center (details are in
the <a
href="flatfiles/object_sdss_imaging.fits.html">object_sdss_imaging
file description</a>).</p>

<p> We match all of the objects to the SDSS spectroscopic survey, to
the FIRST radio survey, to the 2MASS Point Source Catalog, to the
2MASS extended source catalog, to the Two-degree Field Galaxy Redshift
Survey, to the IRAS Point Source Catalog Redshift Survey, and to Reference
Catalog 3 (RC3.9b). </p>

<p> We present all the data in the form of <a
href="http://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/heasarc/fits.html">FITS</a>
binary tables, <a href="yanny.html">FTCL parameter files</a>, and
mangle-style polygon files.  <a href="http://spectro.princeton.edu">
idlutils</a> contains tools for reading all of these files into IDL
structures.</p>

<p>
In the $VAGC_REDUX directory are a set of files whose rows are
parallel (the same row in different files always refers to the same
object):</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a href="flatfiles/object_catalog.fits.html">object_catalog.fits</a>:
coordinates of every object, and their positions (zero-indexed) in
the constituent catalogs.</li>
<li><a href="flatfiles/object_sdss_imaging.fits.html">object_sdss_imaging.fits</a>:
some photometric catalog data for all of the objects in the catalog.</li>
<li><a href="flatfiles/object_sdss_spectro.fits.html">object_sdss_spectro.fits</a>:
spectroscopic catalog data for all of the objects.</li>
<li><a href="flatfiles/object_sdss_tiling.fits.html">object_sdss_tiling.fits</a>:
tiling catalog data for all of the objects.</li>
<li><a href="flatfiles/object_twomass.fits.html">object_twomass.fits</a>:
2MASS Extended Source Catalog data for all the objects.</li>
<li><a href="flatfiles/object_pscz.fits.html">object_pscz.fits</a>:
PSCz catalog data for all the objects.</li>
<li><a href="flatfiles/object_rc3.fits.html">object_rc3.fits</a>:
RC3 catalog data for all the objects.</li>
<li><a href="flatfiles/object_twodf.fits.html">object_twodf.fits</a>:
2dFGRS catalog data for all the objects.</li>
<!--
<li><a href="flatfiles/object_galex.fits.html">object_galex.fits</a>:
GALEX GR1 catalog data forall the objects.</li>
<li><a href="flatfiles/object_swire.fits.html">object_swire.fits</a>:
Spitzer SWIRE catalog data for all the objects.</li>
-->
</ul>
<p>
Each row refers to the same object in all of the files; that is, the
data in row 10 of object_twomass.fits is the 2MASS data available for
the object in row 10 of object_sdss_imaging.fits.
</p>

<p> Note that the above files only contain the objects in each survey
which match entries in <a
href="flatfiles/object_sdss_imaging.fits.html">
object_sdss_imaging</a>. In order to access the other objects from the
survey in question, you can
look in files of the form:</p>
<pre>
$VAGC_REDUX/[name]/[name]_catalog.fits
</pre>
<p>
See the documentation for the "object_" files for more details. </p>

<p> Some derived quantities are also available for each object in
subdirectories. Currently these consist of:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a href="collisions.html">collisions</a>: a best redshift for
each object including correction for collisions, using several
methods.</li>
<li><a href="cutouts.html">cutouts</a>: some cutout images of
selected objects.</li>
<li><a href="doublestar.html">doublestar</a>: detection of
poorly deblended double stars.</li>
<li><a href="kcorrect.html">kcorrect</a>: K-corrections of the
ugrizJHK magnitudes.</li>
<li><a href="lowz.html">lowz</a>: a specially prepared catalog of
low-redshift galaxies <b>[NOT FOR DR6 OR DR7 YET]</b>.</li>
<li><a href="matchspec.html">matchspec</a>: matching
objects to spectra more generously (connecting objects further
than 2 arcsec).</li>
<li><a href="parents.html">parents</a>: properties of parent objects.</li>
<li><a href="quality.html">quality</a>: eyeball quality checks.</li>
<li><a href="sersic.html">sersic</a>: SÃ©rsic radial profile fits.</li>
<li><a href="simpleden.html">simpleden</a>: simple overdensity estimator.</li>
<li><a href="velmod_distance.html">velmod_distance</a>: distances
corrected for peculiar velocities.</li>
</ul>


<h2><a id="geometry">Description of the geometry of the catalog</a></h2>

<p> For the SDSS imaging survey we have an <a
href="flatfiles/sdss_imaging_geometry.fits.html"> expression for its geometry
in terms of spherical polygons</a>. </p>

<p> However, for most people who are
worried about the angular selection function, it is best to use a
large-scale structure subsample, where the imaging, target, and tiling
masks are combined and the flux limit and completeness are tracked as
a function of position.  In the $LSS_REDUX/dr72
directory are the
files:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a href="flatfiles/lss_combmask.fits.html">lss_combmask.dr72.fits</a>:
geometry of the sample, with areas around bright stars excised.</li>
<li><a href="flatfiles/lss_index.fits.html">lss_index.dr72.fits</a>:
positions plus which lss_combmask polygon each catalog entry is in.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The geometry is built out of two separate files, one expressing the
window and the other expressing the bright star mask:
</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a href="flatfiles/lss_geometry.fits.html">lss_geometry.dr72.fits</a>:
file describing geometry of the full large-scale structure sample.</li>
<li><a href="flatfiles/lss_bsmask.fits.html">lss_bsmask.dr72.fits</a>:
file describing the bright star mask.</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition there are a number of subdirectories. Each
subdirectory corresponds to a "pre-redshift" selection criterion; this
means that the objects and the area of sky have been selected
according to flux limit, completeness, and other properties which do
not require knowing the object redshift. Further subdirectories
provide complete subsamples based on cuts made after the redshift
determination: on redshift, luminosity, intrinsic color, etc. <a
href="lss.html"> Further details</a> on the large-scale structure
samples are available.
</p>

<h2><a id="software">Software tools</a></h2>

<p> We use a large suite of tools in order to create this catalog. The
basics are all in <a href="http://spectro.princeton.edu">
idlutils</a>. Public tools for dealing with the spectra are in <a
href="http://spectro.princeton.edu"> idlspec2d</a>. Public tools for
dealing with the imaging data are in <a
href="http://photo.astro.princeton.edu"> photoop</a>.  These are all
IDL products, and you need IDL to use them. But you are an astronomer,
and probably need IDL anyway (sigh).</p>

<p>
Deserving of special mention are several tools within the latest
version of idlutils:</p>

<ul class="simple">
<li><i>vagc_read.pro</i> - code to quickly read in VAGC objects a circular
region around some point:<br />
<pre>         objs= vagc_read(ra, dec, radius)</pre></li>
<li><i>sdss_sweep_circle.pro</i> - code to quickly read ALL SDSS objects in a
circular region around some point:
<pre>         objs= sdss_sweep_circle(ra, dec, radius)</pre></li>
</ul>

<p> A special piece of code that has been useful to use (and is
compiled into idlutils) is <a
href="http://space.mit.edu/~molly/mangle/">mangle</a>, a set of
tools for dealing with angular masks developed by Andrew Hamilton and
Max Tegmark. An old version of this code (v1.4) is distributed with <a
href="http://spectro.princeton.edu"> idlutils</a>.</p>


<h2><a id="datasweep">Datasweeps of full SDSS catalog</a></h2>

<p> One of the very useful tools that we use to build the NYU-VAGC are
the "datasweeps" of the full SDSS catalog. These are compressed
versions of the full catalog that have only the decent
detections. They occupy a very small amount of disk space (about 90G)
so are usefully small. They do not have all of the photometric
information in them, though, which is a drawback. </p>

<p> All of the data for DR7 is at: <a
href="http://sdss.physics.nyu.edu/datasweep/dr7/">
http://sdss.physics.nyu.edu/datasweep/dr7/</a></p>

<p>
There are two catalogs, split into stars and galaxies.  For stars, the
datasweeps have any stars where the PSF extinction-corrected
magnitudes are brigher than the following for at least one band: u &lt;
22.5, g &lt; 22.5, r &lt; 22.5, i &lt; 22, z &lt; 21.5. The catalog is
broken down into runs and camcols, and is in files with the names:
</p>
<pre>
calibObj-[run]-[camcol]-star.fits.gz
</pre>

<p> Similarly, for galaxies , they have any galaxies where the model
extinction-corrected magnitudes are brigher than the following for at
least one band: u &lt; 21.0, g &lt; 22.0, r &lt; 22.0, i &lt; 20.5, z &lt;
20.1. The names of the files for each run and camcol are:</p>
<pre>
calibObj-[run]-[camcol]-gal.fits.gz
</pre>

<p> The meanings of the columns of the FITS files conform to the
naming conventions at the <a href="http://photo.astro.princeton.edu">
Princeton reductions site</a>. Important things to remember are:</p>
<ul class="circle">
<li>To get only one instance of each object, require
(RESOLVE_STATUS &amp; 256) &gt; 0 (as described on the <a
href="http://photo.astro.princeton.edu/#dm_resolve">Princeton site</a>).</li>
<li>Fluxes are not Galactic extinction corrected, and are in
nanomaggies.</li>
<li>Radii are generally given in PIXELS (each SDSS pixel is 0.396
arcsec)</li>
<li>For stars, the 2MASS PSC magnitudes are included.</li>
</ul>

<a name="problems">
<h2> Known problems</h2>

<ul> <li> In the LSS sample of the "dr72" release, there are a number
of RA and Dec values in "lss_index" that do not agree with those in
the "object_sdss_imaging" file (1220 to be exact). These are cases
where the photometry listed in the LSS sample ACTUALLY corresponds to
that of the parent object, because we made an <a href="eyeball.html">
eyeball determination</a> that that photometry would be better. (See
the <a href="parents.html"> description of the parents tables</a>). In
and of itself, that is not a problem.  However, a couple dozen of
those entries actually point back to the SAME parent, and thus look
like repeat entries. This causes a very slight double-counting problem
(though it is still LESS severe than if we had just taken the original
catalog as-is). Thanks to Xiao-hu Yang for pointing this out.</li> 
<li> The "combmask" files inside the "pre-redshift" subdirectories
are incorrectly built
($LSS_REDUX/[sample]/[letter]/combmask.[sample][letter].fits).
This does not affect anything downstream, since the "lss_combmask"
file is still correctly built, and the random catalogs are all 
based on that file. 
 Thanks to Chia-Hsun Chiang for pointing this out.</li>
